## Developing

This is a meta-package for all of the sub-repos under Roleypoly. Because this is a distributed system, you might not need to develop on all of these at once to get something done. *Docs in future.*

### Prerequisites

- [Discord OAuth/Bot Application](https://discordapp.com/developers)
- Go 1.12+ w/ `GO111MODULES=on`
- Node 12+
- Yarn
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for self-signing certs for `roleypoly.local *.roleypoly.local`
- /etc/hosts entry for the above

Some parts of development can be done online or integrated into the online systems hosted on roleypoly.com or canary.roleypoly.com.
