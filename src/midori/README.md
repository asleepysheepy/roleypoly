# Midori

Midori is a GitOps/GitHub Actions/Terraform Cloud helper bot. In it's simplest form, it is a hotline into GitHub Actions and Terraform Cloud to run and act upon the actual pipelines and such.

This is **not** a public bot for very obvious reasons. You may host it yourself, but it is not a required part of a Roleypoly deployment.
